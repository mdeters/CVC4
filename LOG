* Speed up recursive parallel make by allowing the building of several of the
  subdirectories.  Thanks to Francois for bringing up this issue at IJCAR,
  causing me to look at it again.  (Kshitij and others have previously
  requested this, too---but automake doesn't support it out of the box, and
  a good way to do it didn't occur to me until this week.)  This speeds up
  "make -j4" debug builds on church from 156 seconds to
  119 seconds---a 24% savings for first-time builds!  Note that it does
  change the order in which things are built, since previously enforced
  (but unneeded) dependences have been broken, and "make" now gets new
  flexibility in when to build different components.

  This doesn't affect "make clean," "make dist," "make check," etc.

  Let me know if this breaks anything; it may well.
  "make -j" (without a limiting # of processes to start) is now inadvisable.
